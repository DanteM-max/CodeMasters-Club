    <ul>
        <li>
            <ul>Be punctual
                <li>Meetings should start and end on time. Some of our current members have practices right after meetings, so this will be especially important. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meetings are every Tuesday from 3:05 to 3:40</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
                Come prepared
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is something important that we have to do by a specific deadline, make sure you do your part in getting it done. Also, since we're 
                    going to be using Unity, if you miss a meeting, make sure you get caught up so that we can work at our best pace and make more games!
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul> Participation is encouraged!
                <li>We'll all learn how to do game development, so if we need you, please be prepared to help. </li>
